When building this app I was able to get all of the data to import from the JSON files and display in three different tabs. Deploying to heroku gave me a lot of trouble because I was trying to use sqlite3 instead of postgres for my production database. I was able to get the bootstrap set up and used the ui for my tabs, tables, and header. When I have more time on Rails PA2 I would like to further clean up the page with bootsrap UI to make it look better. I have included links below to my github and heroku deployments.
