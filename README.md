My home page will display the enrollements for the user that is logged into the applicaiton, if no user is logged in it will show a log in and sign up button. Once the user is logged in they are able to search for courses by clicking on the search tab. The search filters allow the user to search course by name or subject. The results are shown below and have an enroll button next to them. Once the user has been enrolled in courses they are able to look at their enrolled courses on the home page. One short cut to the home page is clicking on the Course Catelog menu on the top nav bar as it links back to the home page.
